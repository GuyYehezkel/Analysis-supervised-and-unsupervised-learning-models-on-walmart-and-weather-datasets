Analysis supervised and unsupervised learning models on Walmart and weather-datasets

This is the work of me and my co-student Aviv Lugasi in the course Machine learning.

In this work we analysed sales data of 111 items from 45 walmarts branches acrros the US, we also analysed NOA's weather data, and then We checked how the weather affect the sales. We performed several Processes on the data that included:

-exclusion (features selection, null drop..etc).

-data imputation(Using KNN).

-data transformation(Log transform, one hot encoding).

-features engineering(creating new features based on analysis we performed).

-dimension reduction(PCA for the clustering phase).

We created different regression models for predicting the sum of units of specific items in each store on a given date. We created classification models for predicting if a given date was rainy or not at store 11 based on the sales data. Using the stations and sea level air pressure features, we estimated the elevation of each weather station, using the barometric formula. Finnaly we using PCA and different clusterig models we clustered the weather stations.
